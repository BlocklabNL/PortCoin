# Research project proposal PortCoin (CONCEPT)

By: BlockLab & Port of Rotterdam

Date: Feb 2018

### Setting:

One of the largest constraints in supply chain optimization projects is to facilitate and stimulate cooperation and information sharing between companies that have no contractual connection between them, but are ‘forced’ to work together due to their customers arrangements.

Example: deepsea container terminals handle barge, rail and road volumes. The shipper/receiver/forwarder (hereafter called inland operator) make operational appointments, called slots, for their modalities to be handled at the deepsea terminal. The deepsea terminal invoices its customer (shipping line), the barge operator invoices its customer (the inland operator). There is no contractual relationship between deepsea terminal and inland operator, yet they have to work together to arrange smooth transition between sea and inland transport. Due to the absence of a contract both the deepsea terminal and inland operator have no incentive to adhere to the planned slots. Furthermore, the slots are not interchangeable and terminal and barge do not have a common view on each others transaction. As a result allocated slots are lost effecting both terminal and barge operating efficiency.

### Challenge:

Develop a working prototype that demonstrates how these type of appointments can be valued and traded on a (spot and/or future) market with the use of new technology, for example cryptocurrency, and how the Port Authority should facilitate this.

### Initial idea:

Establish a default/standard for such a market, including standardization of transaction data, pricing algorithms and taking into consideration privacy. Launch PortCoins and issue allowance to each major actor in the supply chain. Launch a trading platform (PortExchange) to facilitate the trading/exchange of agreements and of potential other cryptocurrencies that aim to optimize logistics.
